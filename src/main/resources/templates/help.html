        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This application is work in progress. The content is there just as
            a proof of concept. The ultimate goal is to create a library of
            sign language signs, where anyone can search for signs, browse,
            view, download or integrate the content in any way they want.
        </p>

        <h2>Search</h2>
        <p>
            The <a th:href="@{/}">main page</a> can be used to search for any
            kind of sign with free form search. For example you can
            <a th:href="@{/(q=train)}">search for "train"</a>. By default, the
            results are shown as an HTML page. The same results can be
            retrieved as <a th:href="@{/(q=train,format=json)}">JSON</a> by
            adding the <code>format=json</code> query parameter or as
            <a th:href="@{/(q=train,format=atom)}">Atom / OpenSearch</a> by
            adding the <code>format=atom</code> query parameter.
        </p>

        <h2>Signs</h2>
        <p>
            Each sign has a page where you can see all information about that
            sign. For example, the "train" has <a th:href="@{/sign/train}">its
            own page</a>. This can again be viewed as
            <a th:href="@{/sign/train(format=json)}">JSON</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Swagger UI</h2>
        <p>
            A <a th:href="@{/swagger-ui.html}">Swagger endpoint</a> is
            available to browse the available API endpoints and help you get
            familiar with the kind of information available on this
            application.
